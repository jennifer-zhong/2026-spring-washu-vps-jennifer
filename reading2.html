        AI has become so widely used that I see AI generated images and videos everywhere, and I often have to question if what I’m seeing is real or fake. I do think AI can be a useful tool in some contexts, but it is a little scary that now it can pass the Turing test which is supposed to separate human behavior from machine. I like the idea of a new Turing test based on expressiveness with more of a focus on humans. I think intentionally creating art or designs that feel like they have a purpose and unique perspective will allow us to create something that is more meaningful and less generic. It also helps separate human art from AI generated images. This is something that I think can be extremely useful.
