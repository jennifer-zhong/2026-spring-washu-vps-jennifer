        I found this reading to be particularly interesting since as a biomedical engineering major, I have become increasingly familiar with new advances in wearable technologies for healthcare – things that would be considered cyborg enhancements by this author. While I agree with the author that technological advancements for our environment, “rooms,” can be overlooked, I think both cyborgs and rooms are important and just focus on different aspects of our lives. Wearable devices can be extremely important to provide real-time feedback that can help monitor disease or provide important biological data related to health. However, I am interested in the cyborg vs room discussion and this reading brought up a topic I never really considered before. I like the idea that we can “walk away from” room enhancements while cyborg enhancements become a part of us.
