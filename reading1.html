        I found the last line, “Maybe restaurants are just physical blogs,” to be really interesting. Restaurants each have a unique personality and story to tell through their atmosphere, decor, food, etc. I think restaurant websites can be really powerful in capturing the personality of a restaurant using certain design choices, such as color, fonts, or visuals. I agree that using platforms like Squarespace might limit the design options that truly tell you what the restaurant is like in real life. However, I do think there are ways that you can make the restaurant’s personality come across without a lot of front-end coding.
